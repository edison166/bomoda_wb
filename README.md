I code 5 different files using JAVA, which can be found at the folder src. The files are named according to the questionã€‚
In each code, you need change the input path in the main function.

You need to import jar package "json-java.jar" to all the programs before run them.

In order to run WordCount3, you need to also import two jar packages, (IKAnalyzer3.2.8.jar and lucene-core-3.6.0), which are used to cut the sentence into words.

I also attached the results of my run as text files.
